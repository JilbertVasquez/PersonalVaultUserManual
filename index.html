            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Vault is a simple and intuitive desktop application developed in Java using the NetBeans IDE, designed to help users securely manage their various online 
                accounts. The primary function of Vault is for an admin to create initial accounts for accessing the Vault system. Once these accounts are created by the 
                admin, users can log in and add accounts such as their Gmail, providing details like the username, site name, password, and additional info if desired. 
                The application features a user-friendly interface where users can view all their stored accounts in a table format. Moreover, Vault offers functionalities 
                to edit account details, when necessary, delete accounts, and perform searches to locate specific accounts with ease. This project aims to provide a 
                secure and efficient solution for account management, ensuring that users can keep track of their account information with ease.</p>
